    "At the height of the European Industrial Revolution, Parisian industrial organization the Societé d’Encouragement offered a handsome award of six thousand francs to the individual who could develop an economical and physically comparable synthetic version of *lapis lazuli*. The award ultimately went to French chemist Guimet in 1824, and with that, the first synthetic version of ultramarine was born, and it was this synthetic ultramarine that would be subsequently used in seminal painting of the latter portion of the 19th century, among them being Claude Monet’s _Gare Saint-Lazare_, Camille Pissarro’s _The Côte des Bœufs_, and Pierre-Auguste _Renoir’s Les Parapluies_. While this initial version of synthetic ultramarine was almost indistinguishable from its natural counterpart, at least in decontextualized, isolated comparison, the color would continue to undergo development throughout the next century and into the modern era, with each version targeted with greater precision at recreating the abstruse complexity of the original, the various chemical formulas and procedures involved heavily guarded and patented. Indeed, the formula of the first, early 19th century synthetic versions employed by Monet and his contemporaries was so meticulously guarded that modern day research teams, such as the partnership between UK chemist Ian Hamerton and art scientist Nicholas Eastaugh, have gone to great lengths to studying the spectroscopy of and recreating a historically accurate and true version of the original formula, all for the goal of better understanding the works of these 19th century artistic giants who employed *lapis lazuli*, a motivation not unlike that pursued by this dissertation in terms of the study of temperament to arrive at a deeper understanding of Bach's works.\n",

    "While the history of the derivation of ultramarine has seen dynamism in the treatment of the compound across time, the ethos of the quest for ultramarine has remained unchanged---a strict and cardinal dedication to the pursuit of a specific configuration of shade and hue, a staunch faithfulness and unwavering adherence to detail and minute complexities motivated by the belief that these details carry with them and are directly responsible for the artistic integrity of the compositions. Artists, art historians, and scientists alike have unequivocally and unilaterally recognized the necessity for the careful preservation of the original integrity of *lapis lazuli*, not just as a rote scientific pursuit, but more so as an artistic allegiance. Ultramarine was not just a mere shade of blue that could be substituted and replaced, but inherently special and indispensable in its properties, within them encoded a sublime artistic force which would be irredeemably modified with the alteration of the color. The simple conviction, put in laymen's terms, was that these minute shades and properties of colors mattered artistically, so strong was the allegiance to this principle that artists pre-19th century sacrificed their entire lives' savings to attain this precious compound. In the modern day, this assiduous dedication has translated into entire professions being dedicated to the synthetic replication of the shade, the careful restoration of these original paintings, and the painstaking research of the chemical composition of these original versions, all in the effort to preserve the integrity of ultramarine. Even now, with the meticulousness of modern advancement and the ready availability of these synthetic versions of the color, there are still to this day purists and traditionalists that eschew these substitutes, and instead go to great laborative and economic lengths to procure ultramarine in its natural form, grinding the stone themselves. In their eyes, there is still no worthy substitute for the elusive properties of the stone in all the depth, complexity, and subtlety contained in its original form. \n",

    "Today, Vermeer's paintings are dispersed across the globe; the *Young Woman with a Water Pitcher* hangs in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art; *The Milkmaid* and *The Woman with the Blue Reading Letter* can be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and if one travels to the Mauritshuis in the Hague, one can peer across time into the enigmatic eyes of the *Girl with the Pearl Earrings*, as well as behold the *View of Delft*, the iconic scene that the narrator of Marcel Proust's *In Search of Lost Time* pronounced \"as more striking, more different from anything else he knew\". Owing to the careful preservation of some of these masterpieces, and faithful restoration of others, even after the passage of hundreds of years, Vermeer's use of colors still continues to inspire us to great lengths of imagination, awe, and wonder. And as our understanding of ultramarine has deepened over time, scientific knowledge and artistic intuition unfold in a beautiful feedback loop. Understanding just where and how Vermeer employed this ethereal color ultimately allows us a deeper introspection into the artist's mind and revelation of his intimate artistic process, providing us with a more complete comprehension of the indispensability of this color to the magic created from his canvasses, ultimately resulting in a more powerful and authentic experience of these artworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, time has not been kind to all of Vermeer's paintings; natural ultramarine is unfortunately prone to \"ultramarine disease\", in which the pigments fade and blanch over time, altering the artist's intended coloration. For one who relied so heavily upon the compound as Vermeer, and used ultramarine in such holistic, precise, and subtle contexts, the results of this discoloration have been drastic, and many of his paintings appear dramatically shifted from their original, intended states. Indeed, the ramifications of ultramarine disease upon Vermeer's paintings are not as simple as contained, isolated color shifts, but instead hold large scale consequences, with effects that are much more pervasive and insidious, shifting the entire perception of the artistic integrity behind these paintings. French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul first codified this effect of the fickle relativity of color perception with the term 'simultaneous contrast', stating that human perception of individual colors are not fixed, but rather dependent on their composite surroundings. Vermeer was no stranger to this understanding of the relativity and multi-dimensionality of color, and his usage of ultramarine are as much a celebration of the color itself as they are an exercise of how such a powerful, complex color contrasts and alters our perception of the hues around it, as well as its influence on other visual dimensions. The dulling and waning of ultramarine draperies of cloth is not just an isolated, negligible color shift, but a shift in the entire perception of fabric depth and texture, as well as the balance and color interplay against surrounding fabrics; the discoloration of the underlayer of ultramarine on a wall for the subtle effect of illumination results in the alteration of the lighting settings of the entire painting, essentially darkening the perception of the entire room, as well as the perception of light upon the other colors contained within the painting. Ironically, the blanching of Vermeer's ultramarine over time has made us appreciate the subtleties of the artist's usage of the color even more, offering a compelling testament to the principles of simultaneous contrast and the interconnectivity between the artistic dimensions, and how the alteration of one color can change the color scheme, balance, and feel of an entire painting. In this light, efforts of restoration of Vermeer's paintings are essential to the holistic experience of his artworks, and thanks to the tireless efforts of artists and conservators, we are now able to experience a large portion of the paintings closer to the way Vermeer originally envisioned them. For the paintings however in which restoration has not become a current possibility, we only have our imaginations to rely upon, to where our knowledge of ultramarine and its properties, and what they meant to Vermeer, becomes even more crucial, as it remains our last bastion of mental preservations of these timeless artworks and our faithfulness to Vermeer's artistic vision. \n",

    "The story of the historical journey of *lapis lazuli* and its artistic implications is in many ways a beautiful allegorical parallel to the story of temperament embarked upon in this dissertation. In this dissertation, we have demonstrated that temperament to Bach was very much an auditory equivalent to the subtle sensitivity to color on the visual domain, even as far as to draw the metaphor that these tempered intervals were Bach's auditory palette, the bold, idiosyncratic Pythagorean intervals akin to precious ultramarine. From the careful analysis of these pieces, we have been able to unequivocally reject the null hypothesis, as it is evident that Bach cared about temperament, and structured his compositions and keys choices in ways so that certain tempered intervals had deep and intense connections with the underlying musicality and artistic expressivities he sought to convey. Through observing the consistent, strong correlations between various compositional elements, key, and interval, it is evident that Bach was not treating temperament as an auxiliary, discardable historical artifact, or an imperfection to be worked around, but rather regarded it as essential component and artistic tool to the musical makeup of the pieces themselves, affecting musical structures on various levels of compositional scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first chapter of this dissertation's analysis demonstrated how temperament exerted effects on composition on the most basic and general scale, dividing the keys into their historical meantone and Pythagorean groups, not only reflected in the raw tuning scheme, but more importantly reflected in and observable in the patterned grouping of the compositions themselves. It was also in this chapter that we established more prevalent patterns and noticeable effects in the horizontal domain, guiding the analysis for the following chapters to focus more upon the horizontal dimension, and the interval arguably most influential to function and character affect on this dimension in the context of minor mode: the semitone. The second chapter witnesses the incipient emergence of key characteristics through fine-tuning the non-parameterized broad trends of the first chapter, with the goal of pinpointing the compositional components involved in this initial detection of key division. From the intermediate tier, more detailed analysis in this chapter, we revealed how temperament shares a systematic, correlative relationship with key through the underlying functional and musical elements of interval choice mirroring their original, historical predilections, vocal texture, and tempo settings. Towards the end of the chapter, we were able to analyze in depth the interaction between the fifth, third, and horizontal semitone through seeing how temperament affects scalar structures given key, creating increasingly fine-grained differences within key group, and essentially setting a unique coloristic palette for the individual keys. And finally, in the concluding chapter of analysis, we arrived at the most detailed level of thematic structure, and witnessed how these different scalar structures given key were put to masterful use on the thematic level through temperament's influence on integral compositional forces of contrapuntal style, fugal techniques of stretto, musical and motivic symbolism, approach to chromaticism, thematic and motivic structure and development, large scale formal architecture, and thematic and subject choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps most succinctly and elegantly compelling though to the idea of musical significance, like the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast for visual colors, is how Bach has masterfully used these tempered intervals as interplay against one another, like an exercise of light against shade, bright red against cool blue, adjusting his approach to chromaticism to mirror and accentuate the coloristic affects carried within these tempered intervals, resulting in unique, delicate balances of perceptual dissonance and consonance that have over time contributed to the cementing of these key profiles and characteristics into our collective musical consciousness. In fact, temperament's affect on Bach's approach to chromaticism---mirrored in the microcosm of the construction of his fugal subjects given key---is perhaps the most significant and direct finding of the entire thesis. The b-flat minor fugue, with a thematic juxtaposition of pure fifths against narrow, Pythagorean minor ninths and Pythagorean minor tenths, accentuates to the maximum the expressive qualities of the minor modality, creating a key of color and pathos; the grandeur of architecture of the c-sharp minor fugue that emerges from the construction of three contrasting themes, each deeply symbolic of the story of the passion, their characters highlighted and bolstered through temperament and set against a backdrop of uniform, narrow chromaticism conjures a key of solemn, meditative lamentation, and the dissonant, strange subjects of the b and f minor fugues are brought to sense and perfected through the high variation of tempered intervals contained by their home keys, cementing the idiosyncratic nature of these boundary keys---all of these fugues and their respective subjects reliant upon their unique temperamental key palettes for these specific tempered intervals and their complex color profiles. To divest from Bach's work the color subtleties of these temperamental forces would be a certain removal of several musical dimensions of his music, of one of them this crucial, chromatic dimension that forms the backbone of these deeply expressive minor fugues, impacting the genetic makeup of these compositions as a whole. \"It is but a minute acoustical shift,\" one skeptic might say. Or perhaps, \"There is barely anything detectable between the two different shades if we place the intervals back to back in a decontextualized, comparison study of sine waves.\" But to opine measuring musical significance in such a limited manner betrays an uninformed naïveté towards the subtlety and complexities of these artistic forces, and just how interactive, intertwined, and deeply contextual their structures are. At the end of the day though, strict auditory tests can indeed only touch as far as the auditory realm; to reach further into the realm of music, the true litmus test remains our ability to demonstrate that temperament is embedded into the fabric of these pieces in an artistically meaningful way, that Bach was employing temperament in ways that deeply impacted the musical structure and thematic designs of these underlying pieces, which is precisely what we have shown in this dissertation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside these large scale effects of holistic structure though, there yet remains the beautiful idiosyncrasies of these intervallic colors themselves. As writer Ravi Mangla phrases eloquently in his article musing upon the history of ultramarine, in this specific context, referring to the movement towards the substitution of the natural compound with synthetic versions: \"'A color may be too pure. Modern shades and colors often appear hideous, ironically, because of their extreme purity,' writes Alexander Theroux in his triptych of essays The Primary Colors. 'Old-fashioned blue, which had a dash of yellow in it … now seems often incongruous against newer, staring, overly luminous eye-killing shades.' In our pursuit of perfection, of unspoiled coloration, we purged colors of their unique characters. Even the finest natural ultramarine, ground assiduously by hand, is riddled with odd minerals: calcite, pyrite, augite, mica. These deposits cause the light to be refracted and transmitted in subtly different ways. No two strokes of paint are the same in their fundamental composition. Stand at the right angle and you might catch a quiet glimmer of white or gold, like a prick of light from some distant province of the cosmos.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarities between the way that these visual artists regard the natural, complex state of ultramarine, and the nature of the distribution of interval impurity within well-temperament are striking, in that the focus is not so much upon extolling the virtues of purity within intervals or colors, but rather in praise of the natural impurities of the original material from whence these artistic forces derive their character. In Bach's case, we have seen that he does not shy away from these idiosyncratic---oftentimes non-pure---intervals of the remote Pythagorean keys, but rather celebrates them, showcasing them in motivically and thematically important contexts---the opening statement of a fugue, the lone idiosyncratic thematic interval, the boldness of a dissonant subject. While there exists the narrative that well-temperament was designed to preserve purity in meantone keys, yet it is in these Pythagorean keys in which Bach's pathos and chromaticism shines the brightest---it is in these remote keys, where the musical ultramarines exist, in which Bach compositional approach is at its most creative, most expressive, most memorable. What then would be the ramifications towards these pieces if we were to enforce upon them a more \"correct\" equal temperament, as the standard for tuning? From our understanding of Bach's usage of color and how it directly relates to temperament, this logic would be as absurd as to champion the removal of Vermeer's original ultramarine, and placing synthetic color in its stead, with the reason that synthetic color is more pure, or even more egregiously, to substitute ultramarine with a slightly different shade of blue---cobalt, or azure. But even if we were somehow even able to supernaturally suspend the properties of mathematical and physical laws of acoustics to accommodate simultaneous and ubiquitous pure intervals, would Bach have abandoned well-temperament for this holy grail of acoustical purity? The analysis from this dissertation asserts that he would not have wanted it so. His Eden had already been discovered, in all its imperfect perfection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equipped with this knowledge of how extensive temperament was to the construction of Bach's pieces, how can we not then dedicated time and effort to temperament-focused analysis, and to the restoration of these compositions in performance under their original temperamental settings? The players and proponents of the visual arts have ubiquitously recognized the value of this, and it is time that we in the auditory arts follow suit. Art scientist Eastaugh, referring to the artistic importance behind the painstaking spectroscopic research on the composition of ultramarine, certainly concurs: \"If you want to see how Van Gogh or Monet could paint the way they did, then you need to do these kinds of studies; if you want to protect our cultural heritage, work out why it is falling apart and what to do about it, then you need information from investigations like this.\" Likewise, we as artists on the auditory domain have a comparable responsibility to strive to understand Bach's compositions from the eyes of temperament if we are to continue to champion and preserve the artistic integrity of these precious works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This now begs the question of realization: should we continue to perform Bach's works under the setting of equal temperament, even if our convictions and the data all indicate the musical importance of well-temperament---would this not be artistic compromise? Should we not be championing for a revolution towards well-tempered tuning for pieces realized under well-temperament, at least in the case of the pieces that we have studied? Certainly in an ideal world, performing Bach's works in well-temperament would be the clear goal, and it is a direction that we should be heading towards, just like restoration is a goal for paintings, especially once we have knowledge of how these colors play an eminent role in the artistic structures. However, in the musical case, from a feasible standpoint, the current structures simply do not support such a radical shift, given the deep dichotomization between the modern tuner and performer, as well as our puerile understanding of the sensitivities to the complexities of well-temperament, having been long saturated in the tradition of equal temperament. Under this light of current impracticality, does this then render temperamental analysis, and our goals for the restoration of well-temperament zealous and radical? If not for a push towards the goal of temperament restoration, what value does our temperament based analysis hold for the theorist, and perhaps even more saliently, for the performer? As a response, an apt analogy can be drawn to the performance of a piano transcriptions of orchestral works, and the responsibility and importance for the performer’s understanding of the orchestral origins of the work for a meaningful and artistically accurate performance. The knowledge of the original sounds and sonic intentions are not only valuable but indispensable to the performer who wishes to recreate with faithfulness the richness and variety of the original sonic tapestry of flutes, trumpets, drums, and violins, even though the physical forces through transcription are but felt hammers against metal strings. But herein lies the power and importance of musical imagination: it is the precise principle that the artworks exist first in the minds of the performer; only then can they be adequately translated to the listener. Indeed, if we as creators are not able to have the rigorous construct of the original form of the artistic vision first in our minds, what can we hope for in the validity of our translations, and the resulting understanding of our audience? In the same way, the intimate knowledge of temperament, its intervallic forces, and their respective interactions with the underlying musical structures of the compositional substrate must be first established in the collective consciousness of the minds of musicians before we can hope to translate these artworks, and their musical messages, to the general population. We have witnessed the same principles in regards to the Vermeer paintings in which original color has not yet been restored, in that, in these cases, our mental understanding of the complex nature of ultramarine and the artist's usage of the color remains crucial in connecting us to Vermeer's original artistic intent. Likewise, our understanding of well-temperament and its creative agents, in the possible lack of current restoration, is the only force aiding us towards the composer's original sonic intent, and it is this very mental construct of these original sounds that will ultimately guide and inform performances to more faithful renditions of Bach's authentic artistry. Lastly, it is towards our continual evolution as artists and artistic thought that we must strive to keep the artistic past alive through faithful preservation. Newton once uttered the now famous words, \"If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants\". Analysis helps us learn from the giants of the past, for without faithful understanding and recreation of this artistic past, we lose sight of where we have come from, what achievements have been made and revelations discovered for us, so that we do not have to mire ourselves in the process of rediscovery, but can instead take upon us the torch of progress and move forward in continual innovation. More than anything, this is why analysis is powerful, this is why it is important, this is why it is irreplaceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a larger philosophical framework, what I have sought to illuminate through this dissertation are these neglected dimensions of Bach’s music---a heightened sense of color engendering an emotional affect that is inextricably tied to the subtle variation of interval sizes---that has been essentially forgotten in an era that has eradicated this diversity through the hegemony of equal temperament. The results of this dissertation have demonstrated that there is more artistic import to tuning than meets the eye, and our modern system of seeing the tuning and tempering of the keyboard as a scientific and mechanical endeavor separate from artistic production is doing a great disservice to our sensitivity to tonality, harmony, and musical coloration. Historically, the integral role that tuning and temperament played in regards to its control over harmony and coloration was understood and appreciated by composers and theorists, and tuning was viewed as more of an art rather than a science. Furthermore, there was no dichotomy between the role of a tuner and the role of a musician---composers and performers were expected to be able to tune their own instruments, and although there were general guidelines to follow for the procedure, the subtle nuances were not codified, thus allowing for degrees of variation in tempering across different individuals, very much akin to variations that arise across different performers of the same piece due to artistic voice. Additionally, systems that featured different sized semitones—leading to wider array of intervals, which in turn govern key coloration---were favored over the uniformity and blandness of equal temperament.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the modern era with its dissociation of the tuner from the performer, as well as the widespread standardization of equal temperament to the point of the rendering unequal systems obsolete, has divested us of certain awareness and understanding of the full artistic implications that the composers intended. It is my hope that this dissertation will open up this new avenue of temperamental analysis, leading to a more complete understanding of Bach’s music, not just as a form of reenactment and rediscovery, but also as a platform for a more diversified way of looking at harmony and its creative agents, transforming our experience of music that we come in contact with and future compositions that we aspire to create.
